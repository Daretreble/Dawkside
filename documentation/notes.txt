Ideas:
- Offer a dashboard for all active daws.
- Create a chord play mode for keys and pads.

Bugs:
	- Pickup mode not working well if a parameter appears twice in the grid.

To do:
	- Adapt all selected controllers.
	- Adjust 400-407 to 430-437 accordingly when using play m odes.
	- Add all light feedback for buttons. (midi note, mouse event, etc..)
	- Add direct page selection.
	- Add pedal actions.
	- Add rotary sensitivity to encoders.
	- Convert modwheel to parameter adjustment, when needed.
	- Single fader action for X-Touch one.

Later:
	- Various screen implementations.
